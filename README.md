## BRIDGES APP / BOKKA

Hello Porter! Welcome to B.R.I.D.G.E.S, America's one and _only_ delivery service. Your task is to take on jobs and deliveries when our citizens need them! To do this, you'll need bridges app, a worker-facing interface to locate new oppotunities and jobs.

## MVP

### WORKER USER
- As a user, I would like to be able to log in as either a worker or a requester.
- As a porter user, I would ideally like to be greeted with the closest tasks made by requesters.
- As a porter user, I would like to be able to accept or decline jobs.
- As a porter user, I would like to be able to indicate that I've completed a job.

### REQUESTER USER
- As a requester user, I would like to be able to log in as a requester.
- As a requester user, I would like to be able to make make requests in the form of tasks or deliveries.
- As a requester, I would like to be able to indicate location and ideal time-frame for delivery.
- As a requester, I would like to be able to rate the delivery based upon the condition of the delivered item.

## STRETCH GOALS
- As a User, I would like to create a mock payment portal.
- As a User, I would like to be able to review the Porter.
- As a Porter User, I would like to be able to find the best pedestrian path to make my deliveries.
- As a Porter User/User, I would like to see the progress of my order.
- User should be able to add pictures of their packages.
- Maybe have an option to allow porters to order and customers to deliver.

## POTENTIAL BLOCKERS
- Not being able to call the Mapbox API In the way that I want.
- Model/Schema confusion.
- User Authentication/Permission with the multiple types of users.
- API Struggles.
- State management in Order Processing / Payment

## TECHNICAL STACK

Frontend: REACTJS

Backend:
- Django might make it easier to handle user accounts, permissions and views.
- Express/Node I have familiarity with -- not a big fan of the strategy though (tedious to test!).

Database:
- MongoDB or Postgresql?
  - I would like more experience with Mongo, but I also like the idea of having to architect everything prior.
